Per default only object metrics are measured and stored by ImageC.
With the measure intensity command it is possible to measure the image intensity of the detected areas of interest.
ImageC allows you to select the channels for which the intensity should be measured, whether or not a z-projection should be applied, and which z-stack should be measured.
