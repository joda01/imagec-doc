The goal in developing ImageC was to use as few computing resources as possible.
This means that ImageC can be executed on standard home computers and laptops, as well as on high-performance computing clusters.

Nevertheless, even the most efficient image processing application requires at least a couple of hardware components to run smoothly.
This chapter gives an overview of the ImageC footprint and hardware resources.
