title: Files Created by ImageC
---

ImageC creates several files and directories on your disk.
Some global files are created and retained even after an update to ImageC, while some local files are generated directly within the ImageC installation folder. 
Additionally, some analysis artifacts are generated when an analysis is started.

## File types

Following file types can be generated by ImageC.

| Endian        | Description 
|-------        |-------------------
|`.icdb`        |SQL database file containing results data. Under the hood a DuckDB storage format.
|`.ictbl`       |ImageC results table settings file. Used to reload table settings in the results view.
|`.icproj`      |ImageC project file, containing all project settings.
|`.ictemplproj` |ImageC project template file for reusing and sharing project settings.
|`.ictempl`     |ImageC pipeline template file for reusing and sharing pipeline settings.
|`.ictemplcc`   |ImageC classification template file for reusing and sharing class settings.
|`.icmlmlppt`   |ImageC ANN MLP pixel classifier model.
|`.icmlrtreemp` |ImageC Random Forest pixel classifier model.
|`.icroi`       |ImageC serialised manual annotated region of interests.


## Global Files and Directories

ImageC creates the following global files in the user's home directory on startup.
For Unix based systems (Linux, macOS) a folder `~/.imagec` is generated.
For Windows based systems a folder `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\imagec` is generated.

The folder contains following files and directories

| Name                        | Description 
|-------                      |-------------------
|`~/imagec/user_settings.json`| Stores some global user settings, like the list of last opened files
|`~/imagec/templates`         | Project, pipeline and classification templates which the user has been created. Copy the new templates into this folder for easy access within ImageC.



## Local Files and Directories

ImageC creates the following files and directories in the installation folder of ImageC.

| Name                    | Description
|-------                  |-------------------|
| `./models`              | Copy AI models within this folder to use them within ImageC.
| `./hs_err_pid<NR>.log`  | Error/Trace log of the BioFormats Java integration.


## Project files

Once a new project is created press `Save` to store your ImageC project the first time.
The default project filename is `settings.icproj`.
A couple of further files are created by ImageC within the same folder where the project file is stored, and these are used to store all additional project settings.

| Name                                | Description 
|-------                              |-------------------
|`⟨project_directory⟩/settings.icproj`{:.language-sql .highlight} | ImageC project file, containing all project and pipeline settings.
|`⟨project_directory⟩/models`{:.language-sql .highlight} | ImageC stores all your trained ML models within this folder. Also copy all pre-trained models that you want to use in your pipelines to this folder.
|`⟨project_directory⟩/data/⟨IMAGE-ID⟩`{:.language-sql .highlight} | ImageC stores all manually created annotations into the data folder using the `.icroi` file endian. For each image a individual folder with an image ID is created.



## Files created during analysis

When an analysis is started, ImageC makes a copy of the whole project settings to the results folder.
This enables the pipeline to be rerun at a later stage with the exact same settings, if necessary.
In addition, the analysis results are stored in the same directory. 
This includes a database file called `results.icdb` containing all the quantified data, as well as an `./images` folder containing the generated control images.


| Name                    | Description
|-------                  |-------------------|
| `⟨image_directory⟩/imagec/results/⟨job_name⟩/results.icdb`{:.language-sql .highlight} | Database file containing all results of the run. The file can be opened with the ImageC [results viewer]({% link docs/stable/first_steps/results.md %}) or with SQL knowledge using one of the [duckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) clients.
| `⟨image_directory⟩/imagec/results/⟨job_name⟩/profiling.json`{:.language-sql .highlight}  | Statistics about the execution time of each individual pipeline step.
| `⟨image_directory⟩/imagec/results/⟨job_name⟩/settings.icproj`{:.language-sql .highlight} | A copy of the project settings when the job has been started.
| `⟨image_directory⟩/imagec/results/⟨job_name⟩/images`{:.language-sql .highlight} | A folder containing all control images generated during the run.
| `⟨image_directory⟩/imagec/results/⟨job_name⟩/models`{:.language-sql .highlight} | A copy of the models folder of the origin project.
| `⟨image_directory⟩/imagec/results/⟨job_name⟩/data`{:.language-sql .highlight} | A copy of the data folder of the origin project.
