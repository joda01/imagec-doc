title: Files Created by ImageC
---

ImageC creates several files and directories on your disk.
Some global files are created and retained even after an update to ImageC, while some local files are generated directly within the ImageC installation folder. 
Additionally, some analysis artifacts are generated when an analysis is started.

## File types

Following file types can be generated by ImageC.

| Endian        | Description 
|-------        |-------------------
|`.icdb`        |SQL database file containing results data. Under the hood a DuckDB storage format.
|`.ictbl`       |ImageC results table settings file. Used to reload table settings in the results view.
|`.icproj`      |ImageC project file, containing all project settings.
|`.ictemplproj` |ImageC project template file for reusing and sharing project settings.
|`.ictempl`     |ImageC pipeline template file for reusing and sharing pipeline settings.
|`.ictemplcc`   |ImageC classification template file for reusing and sharing class settings.


## Global Files and Directories

ImageC creates the following global files in the user's home directory on startup.
For Unix based systems (Linux, macOS) a folder `~/.imagec` is generated.
For Windows based systems a folder `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\imagec` is generated.

The folder contains following files and directories

| Name     | Description 
|-------   |-------------------
|`~/imagec/user_settings.json`| Stores some global user settings, like the list of last opened files
|`~/imagec/templates`| Project, pipeline and classification templates which the user has been created. Copy the new templates into this folder for easy access within ImageC.



## Local Files and Directories

ImageC creates the following files and directories in the installation folder of ImageC.

| Name                    | Description
|-------                  |-------------------|
| `./models`              | Copy AI models within this folder to use them within ImageC.
| `./hs_err_pid<NR>.log`  | Error/Trace log of the BioFormats Java integration.


## Files created during analysis

When an analysis is started, ImageC automatically creates some job artefacts in the selected image working directory.
If no job name was given in the project settings, a unique job name is generated for each run.

| Name                    | Description
|-------                  |-------------------|
| `⟨working_directory⟩/imagec/⟨job_name⟩/results.icdb`{:.language-sql .highlight} | Database file containing all results of the run. The file can be opened with the ImageC [results viewer]({% link docs/stable/first_steps/results.md %}) or with SQL knowledge using one of the [duckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) clients.
| `⟨working_directory⟩/imagec/⟨job_name⟩/profiling.json`{:.language-sql .highlight}  | Statistics about the execution time of each individual pipeline step.
| `⟨working_directory⟩/imagec/⟨job_name⟩/settings.icproj`{:.language-sql .highlight} | A copy of the project settings when the job has been started.
| `⟨working_directory⟩/imagec/⟨job_name⟩/images`{:.language-sql .highlight} | A folder containing all control images generated during the run.
