# What is ImageC?

**ImageC is open source software for high throughput bioimage analysis.**

ImageC is often used for **single vesicle quantification** applications because it offers a powerful set of templates optimized for working the **EV field** - but it can be applied to lots of other kinds of image and applications as well.

Features include:

- [BioFormats support](https://github.com/ome/bioformats)  
- [OME-XML support](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/)      
- XLSX report generation                                   
- Max. channels                                            
- Max image size                                           
- Support for big tiff                                     
- AI based object detection                                
- Database based result processing                         
- Heatmap generation                                       
- Image density map generation                             
- In image object marker                                   
- Built-in reporting tool                                  
- Side by side image comparison
